# Create Python App

 * refered as CPA
 * Free software: Apache Software License 2.0

## Goal

Full life cycle management for python apps and libs.  Create python boilerplate, develop, update boilerplate and publish.


## State

The repository contains a **WIP MVP** to evaliuate different technologies, workflows and user interface.  It's quick and dirty.

**Not suited for production work.**


## Opinionated

The software is based on decisions regarding project structure and
used libraries.

Current decisions (effecting projects managed with cpa, not just cpa's developemt itself):

 * py.test to run tests
 * git for version control

In evaluation:

 * pipenv vs [poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)


Some of them might end up being configurable, some might never be configurable.  Keeping CPA simple might take priority.
